### Description
This is not a composer package, simply an exampe of how to use Google 2FA with Laravel 5.2+  
Most Google 2FA packages for LAravel don't include middleware or proper directions on how to handle the Login -> OTP/2FA -> Logged In workflow.  
This is just one example, it can likely be done in a much better way, but for this example it's very basic.

### Usage
Instead of providing a full L5 installation with modified files, this is the opposite, just the modified files.  
Take a look for yourself for an idea on how to implement 2FA in L5 with Google Authenticator.
